.SH FORMAT
.B The "/ bin" directory
	The / bin directory is a static directory and is where all the necessary binaries are stored to guarantee basic user-level functions. It only stores user executables, since the binaries necessary for administrative tasks managed by the root user or super-user of the system are in the / sbin directory.
	It also includes the binaries that allow the execution of several standard utilities of the Linux terminal, specifically cat, cd, cp, echo, grep, gzip, kill, ls, mv, rm, ping, su, ps, tar and vi.

.B ls  
It is a command of the Unix operating system and derivatives that shows a list with the files and directories of a certain directory. The results are displayed alphabetically.
